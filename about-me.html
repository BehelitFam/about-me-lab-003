                I'm a budding software developer currently residing in Seattle, WA. I'm passionate about tech
                and hungry to code! I think what folks are starting to do with drones and geospatial mapping is pretty sweet.
                My background is in political science and foreign policy, and while it's a big shift for me to go towards tech,
                I think technology has unprecedented implications for our society and way of life, and I want to be a part of that,
                either through developing technology myself, or by translating my technical skills into actionable knowledge for
                industry, policy makers and the public.</p>
